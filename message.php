                                I am truly excited to share our vision with you. My journey in education and personal development has been shaped by the belief that every individual has the potential to do incredible things. As someone who has witnessed the transformative power of self-expression, leadership, and communication firsthand, I founded Dream Big for College with a simple yet profound mission: to help individuals—no matter where they start—dream big, grow fearlessly, and reach their fullest potential.

                                Growing up, I often struggled to find the right guidance. I faced challenges in finding my voice and building the confidence to pursue my goals. This experience sparked a passion in me to create an organization where others wouldn’t have to navigate these challenges alone. I believe that each person, regardless of their background or circumstances, can achieve greatness with the right guidance and support.
                            </p>
